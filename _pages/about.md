I am a Data Scientist from Austria working at [Anexia](https://anexia.com/en/). In my professional experience I have worked on various projects where I developed, trained, evaluated, and deployed machine learning models for various tasks (classification, regression, anomaly-detection, image-translation, etc.) and built full-stack applications around Large Language Models (Retrieval Augrmented Generation, LLM-Agents, etc.).

During my studies at the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences I fell in love with machine learning as it combines my primary interests, namely Mathematics and Computer Science. My main interests lie in the ideas and concepts behind neural network architectures, as well as the engineering behind training large models. In my free time, I work on open-source software. Currently, I am developing my own dynaimc autograd-engine to train deeplearning models ranging from shallow NNs to Transformers. My aim is to create a transparent and easy-to-understand implementation that can be used as reference material in education.
